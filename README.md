# TestGenie

TestGenie is a **Gen-AI powered record and table generator** that enables users to manage and manipulate data through natural language commands. Whether you need to generate tables, modify records, or conduct SQL and non-SQL operations, TestGenie provides a seamless experience, making data manipulation as simple as asking a question.

## Features
- **Natural Language Commands**: Perform complex SQL and non-SQL operations simply by describing what you want to do. No need to write code; let TestGenie interpret your intent and apply the changes.
- **Record and Table Management**: Easily create, update, and delete records and tables, all through natural language.
- **Result Formatting**: Format query results based on your requirements using natural language prompts, making the data presentation exactly how you envision it.
- **Flask Backend and LLM Integration**: TestGenie relies on a Flask-based backend, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to process user commands, interpret their meaning, and apply changes accordingly.

## Development Journey
This project was initially developed by **Dr. Zhouyayan Li**, who designed and built **80% of the functional modules** and laid the foundation for the entire application structure and logic. The app was later enhanced by a **team of 5**, under the leadership of **Dr. Li**, to finalize the **UI design**, address **backend-frontend integration** issues, and improve the **result export** functionality.


## Key Highlights
- **AI-Driven Data Management**: TestGenie uses the power of AI to bring intuitive and natural interaction to data management.
- **Seamless Backend-Frontend Integration**: A robust architecture ensures smooth communication between the back and front end, making the user experience consistent and efficient.
- **Collaborative Development**: Built initially by one person, the project grew into a collaborative effort that refined and enhanced the user interface and overall application stability.
